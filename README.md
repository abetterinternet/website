===============================================

This is the repository for the [ISRG website](https://abetterinternet.org/).

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and requires version 0.40 or
newer. It's entirely static, no server-side code/scripting.

To see your changes, [install
Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing), then run it with:

```
hugo server -F
```

And open <a href="http://localhost:1313/">http://localhost:1313/</a> in your
browser. Note that the -F flag will show items to be published in the future
(like blog posts with dates in the future).

Contributions welcome.
