- title: 2013 ISRG Founded
  copy: ISRG was founded in May of 2013 by Josh Aas and Eric Rescorla as a home for public benefit digital infrastructure. Josh and Eric were later joined by Alex Halderman and Peter Eckersley, who were at the time developing a protocol for automatically issuing and renewing certificates. These combined efforts were the genesis of Let’s Encrypt. The four started ISRG as a nonprofit, hoping that nonprofit governance requirements would keep the organization transparent and reliable in the long term.ISRG was founded thanks in part to early sponsors and partners Mozilla, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Akamai, Cisco, and the University of Michigan.

- title: 2020 Prossimo Launched
  copy: "Around the same time as the issuance of our billionth certificate in 2020, the ISRG team decided it was time to tackle another significant Internet security threat: memory safety. This project, later named Prossimo, took its first steps when collaborating with maintainer Daniel Stenberg to add options to build curl with memory safe HTTP and TLS libraries."

  copy: In 2020, ISRG partnered with Apple, Google, National Institutes of Health, and The MITRE Corporation on the Exposure Notification Private Analytics (ENPA), a service that enables privacy-preserving metrics collection from Covid-19 exposure notification apps. This work helped to kick off the ISRG Prio services project, which was renamed Divvi Up in 2021.

- title: 2022 Prossimo Supports Rust Merge into Linux kernel
  copy: Support for Rust was merged into the Linux kernel in late 2022. This was the product of years of hard work led by developer Miguel Ojeda, who completed this milestone with support from Prossimo’s Rust for Linux initiative. Though this marked just the beginning for a more memory safe kernel, it was an important first step in building a more secure Web.
