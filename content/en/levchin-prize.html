          On April 13th, <a href="/post/receiving-the-levchin-prize/">Let’s Encrypt was awarded the prestigious Levchin Prize</a> for contributions to real-world cryptography. The <a href="https://rwc.iacr.org/LevchinPrize/" target="_levchin" rel="noopener noreferrer">Levchin Prize</a> is recognition that ISRG’s focused and efficient approach means that practically every person browsing the Web experiences the benefits of cryptography. But technical innovation is just one key to our success.
