<p><a href="https://divviup.org">Divvi Up</a> is a privacy-respecting system for the collection of aggregate statistics, being built by <a href="https://abetterinternet.org">Internet Security Research Group</a>. We allow application owners to collect user data, telemetry, survey results, or other data and produce useful aggregates over that data without being able to determine any individual's measurements.</p>

<p>We're looking for an additional software engineer. Maybe that's you! Here's what our software
engineering team does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We contribute towards the <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/ppm-specification">Privacy Preserving Measurement Protocol</a> specification. PPM is the core protocol underlying the Divvi Up service, and is currently being standardized through the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/priv/about/">IETF</a>.</li>
  <li>We build and maintain <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/janus">Janus</a>, the server software that
  runs our PPM protocol implementation.</li>
  <li>We maintain and operate <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-server">prio-server</a>, the core server software used in the <a href="https://covid19-static.cdn-apple.com/applications/covid19/current/static/contact-tracing/pdf/ENPA_White_Paper.pdf">Exposure Notification Private Analytics</a> system which aggregates US & international COVID-19 exposure information in a privacy-preserving way.</li>
  <li>We contribute to open-source projects we depend on.</li>
  <li>We participate in an on call rotation, with no pager currently and no strict service level. We value protecting our teammates from burnout and accommodate people's schedules as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what we'd like you to bring to the team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One year’s experience writing code in Rust or Go, or two years in another compiled language.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Experience with TypeScript, JavaScript, or another Web frontend language is a plus.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Experience building & operating cloud services in a public cloud such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.</li>
  <li>Attention to detail and a willingness to take time to think things through and do them the right way.</li>
  <li>Experience writing unit tests and integration tests.</li>
  <li>Excellent communication, organization, and prioritization skills.</li>
  <li>At least one cat to show us on video calls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior experience with cryptography or secure systems engineering is not required. We will provide on-the-job training.</p>

<h2>Location and Benefits</h2>

<p>Our team has always been entirely remote and our processes and infrastructure are built around that. We will help you get your home office in good shape, including reimbursing internet and phone expenses. Other benefits include excellent health insurance, a 100% match for 401k contributions, and flexible time off and parental leave policies.</p>

<h2>Applying</h2>

<p>To apply, please submit your resume to: <a href="mailto:careers@letsencrypt.org">careers@letsencrypt.org</a></p>
