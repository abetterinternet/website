The Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your information in two different contexts:

* When you use or interact with an ISRG project
* When you are a Visitor to the ISRG web site (abetterinternet.org), community discussion forum, other web pages under abetterinternet.org, and third-party social media sites on which ISRG operates an account.

## ISRG Projects

Privacy policies for particular ISRG projects can be found via the following links:

* [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/privacy/)

Any ISRG project without its own privacy policy is subject to this general ISRG privacy policy.

## Visitor

When you are a Visitor browsing the ISRG web site, you have the option to make a donation. Donations are processed by our trusted payment partners including DonorBox, Stripe, Shopify, and PayPal, depending on the payment method selected. We collect your name and email address when you donate. We will not use your email address to contact you without your consent unless we feel it's necessary to resolve an issue related to a particular donation. Your interactions with [DonorBox](https://donorbox.org/privacy), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy/), and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) are governed by their respective privacy policies. We do not collect or retain any credit card or bank information related to donations. If we collect a physical address, we will only retain your physical address information for as long as is reasonably necessary to make the shipment that you requested.

You may have the option to provide your email address to receive a newsletter through a signup on this web site and via other marketing materials. Any such newsletter is delivered via MailChimp and your interactions with MailChimp are governed by its privacy policy. We may occasionally use your email address to send personalized communications related to ISRG and its projects. You can request to have your email address removed from our list by opting out via MailChimp or emailing us at [press@abetterinternet.org](mailto:press@abetterinternet.org)

If you register to use an ISRG community support forum, the personal information you provide and your actions there are governed by the privacy policy of our hosting and software provider for the forum, [Civilized Discourse Construction Kit](https://www.discourse.org/privacy). We do not collect or maintain personal information through our offering of this support forum.

Additionally, we use Google Analytics to gauge traffic and popular pages on our web site. As part of that service, we place Google Analytics cookies on our site. These cookies do not contain personal information but can uniquely identify your browser software over time on our site. We respect the [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/) header by strictly limiting the information our analytics services can collect and share for all Visitors.

## We Do Not Sell Your Data or Information

We do not sell your data or information. This includes Relying Party, Subscriber, and Visitor data and information.

## Law Enforcement Requests and Extenuating Circumstances

To the extent we possess it, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances. Such circumstances include when we have your consent or when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order. We may also disclose account recovery information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, damage to property, or significant financial harm.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited, or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by whatever means is reasonably practical. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

In addition, we reserve the right, solely at our discretion, to independently object to certain requests (for access to information about users of our products and technologies) that we believe to be improper.

Your personal data may be collected from or transferred to jurisdictions where we and our service providers store or process data, including the United States. These jurisdictions may not provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction, including the EEA. We have taken steps to ensure that our service providers provide an adequate level of protection for the personal data of EEA residents, including by entering into data processing agreements using the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by using other safeguards approved by the European Commission. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal information is transferring outside the EU by emailing us at the contact information below.

Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights in respect to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, or delete personal data we process through your use of our sites and services. If you're an individual who is a relying party, subscriber, or visitor based in the EEA, you can:

* Request a personal data report by emailing us at security@abetterinternet.org. This report will include the personal data we have about you, provided to you in a structured, commonly used, and portable format. Please note that we may request additional information from you to verify your identity before we disclose any information.
* Request that your information be corrected or deleted by contacting us at security@abetterinternet.org.
* Object to us processing your information. You can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your information to send you service emails. You may withdraw your consent to receive service emails at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within emails.
* Complain to a regulator. If you're based in the EEA and think that we haven't complied with data protection laws, you have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
