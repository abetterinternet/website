The Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your information in two different contexts:

- When you use or interact with an ISRG project
- When you are a Visitor to the ISRG web site (abetterinternet.org), community discussion forum, other web pages under abetterinternet.org, and third-party social media sites on which ISRG operates an account.

## ISRG Projects

Privacy policies for particular ISRG projects can be found via the following links:

Any ISRG project without its own privacy policy is subject to this general ISRG privacy policy.

## Visitor

When you are a Visitor browsing an ISRG web site, you have the option to make a donation. Donations are processed by our trusted payment partners including DonorBox, Stripe, Shopify, and PayPal, depending on the payment method selected, and stored in ISRG's Salesforce database and Sage Intacct as necessary. We collect your name and email address, and, if you provide it, your mailing address when you donate. Once you donate, we will use your information for our legitimate interest in processing and managing your contribution, including fundraising reminders and renewals. Your interactions with [DonorBox](https://donorbox.org/privacy), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy), [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/about/privacy-policy/), Gemini, [SHIPHERO](https://shiphero.com/privacy-data-policy/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/), and [Sage Intacct](https://www.sageintacct.com/privacy_policy_website) are governed by their respective privacy policies. We do not collect or retain any credit card or bank information related to donations.

You may provide your email address to receive communications related to ISRG projects through a signup on an ISRG web site and via other marketing materials. Any communication delivered via Salesforce and your interactions with [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/) are governed by their privacy policies. We may occasionally use your email address to send personalized communications related to ISRG and its projects. You can request to have your email address removed by opting out via the footer of our emails or emailing us at press@abetterinternet.org

If you register to use an ISRG community support forum, the personal information you provide and your actions there are governed by the privacy policy of our hosting and software provider for the forum, [Civilized Discourse Construction Kit](https://www.discourse.org/privacy). We do not collect or maintain personal information through our offering of this support forum.

## We Do Not Sell Your Data or Information

We do not sell your data or information. This includes Relying Party, Subscriber, and Visitor data and information.

## Law Enforcement Requests and Extenuating Circumstances

To the extent we possess it, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances. Such circumstances include when we have your consent or when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order. We may also disclose account recovery information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, damage to property, or significant financial harm.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited, or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by whatever means is reasonably practical. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

In addition, we reserve the right, solely at our discretion, to independently object to certain requests (for access to information about users of our products and technologies) that we believe to be improper.

Your personal data may be collected from or transferred to jurisdictions where we and our service providers store or process data, including the United States. These jurisdictions may not provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction, including the EEA. We have taken steps to ensure that our service providers provide an adequate level of protection for the personal data of EEA residents, including by entering into data processing agreements using the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by using other safeguards approved by the European Commission. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal information is transferring outside the EU by emailing us at the contact information below.

Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain rights in respect to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, or delete personal data we process through your use of our sites and services. If you're an individual who is a relying party, subscriber, or visitor based in the EEA, you can:

- Request a personal data report by emailing us at security@abetterinternet.org. This report will include the personal data we have about you, provided to you in a structured, commonly used, and portable format. Please note that we may request additional information from you to verify your identity before we disclose any information.

- Request that your information be corrected or deleted by contacting us at security@abetterinternet.org.

- Object to us processing your information. You can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your information to send you service emails. You may withdraw your consent to receive service emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link found within emails.
