At the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), we are dedicated to our mission of reducing financial, technological, and educational barriers to secure and private communication over the Internet. This Gift Acceptance Policy outlines the principles that govern our acceptance of donations, ensuring that all contributions support and enhance our mission while upholding our values of independence and integrity.

## 1. Mission Alignment Statement

ISRG accepts donations that support and enhance our mission to reduce barriers to secure and private communication over the Internet. We decline any contributions that could compromise our independence or unduly influence our activities.

## 2. Acceptable and Unacceptable Donation Types

ISRG welcomes donations in the form of cash, securities, and some types of cryptocurrency. If you are considering a donation of non-liquid assets or assets that cannot easily be converted to cash, please get in touch with us to discuss at donate@abetterinternet.org. We will assess the potential difficulty or expense of accepting non-liquid assets and make an acceptance decision on a case by case basis.

## 3. Legal Compliance Statement

ISRG adheres to all legal standards and IRS regulations regarding charitable contributions. We are committed to maintaining transparency and compliance in all our fundraising activities.

## 4. Gift Review Process

The VP of Brand & Donor Development, with support from senior staff and the General Counsel, will review potentially risky gifts to ensure they align with our mission and do not pose legal or ethical concerns. The VP of Brand & Donor Development may escalate acceptance decisions to the Executive Director as needed.

## 5. Donor Recognition and Anonymity

ISRG may recognize donors publicly, unless anonymity is requested. We respect donor privacy and handle anonymous donations confidentially.

## 6. Handling of Restricted Donations

ISRG may accept restricted donations that align with our mission and are feasible to implement. We will review each restricted gift carefully to ensure it supports our strategic goals and can be effectively managed.

## 7. Valuation and Acknowledgement Procedures

ISRG provides donors with acknowledgments and receipts for their contributions, valuing gifts according to IRS guidelines and best practices for charitable organizations.

## 8. Ethical Standards

We are committed to ethical fundraising practices that align with ISRG's mission and values. Our fundraising efforts are conducted with integrity, transparency, and accountability.

## Policy Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually by the VP of Brand & Donor Development to ensure it remains relevant and effective. The VP of Brand & Donor Development is responsible for initiating policy reviews and updates.

## Implementation and Responsibility

The VP of Brand & Donor Development is responsible for enforcing and interpreting this policy. All ISRG staff are expected to adhere to this policy.
