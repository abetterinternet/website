        <h4>A letter to future members:</h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Pursuing a degree or solving scientific problems may require years of commitment. Thus, I truly believe that building a great working culture is the most important thing in our group, definitely more important than publications themselves. In fact, one of the secret sauces for Googleâ€™s decade-long success is its culture.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        At InspiringGroup, we strive to build a unique working culture that is:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Friendly: treating every member with mutual respects is the minimal requirement. At InspiringGroup, we, including myself, are all friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Supportive: we are here to help and support each other. As a team, we will go through all ups and downs during the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flourishing: ultimately, I hope every group member will be flourishing, becoming not only academically successful, but also more mature and well-prepared as a person.
        </li>
      </ul>

        If you are willing to explore new things and work with a group of compassionate people (or you just want to learn how to apply for Top Universities and Companies abroad), feel free to shoot <a href="../team">[me]</a> an email.

        <h4>A second letter to applicants:</h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Due to the limitation of quotas on degree-earning Ph.D./master students, I cannot include each of the outstanding applicants as my graduate students here at Tsinghua. Yet, I maintain mutliple research groups with both Tsinghua and non-Tsinghua students on each of the topics I listed [here](./research). If you want to join these groups, also shoot <a href="../team">[me]</a> an email to explicitly state your interests. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To Post-Doc Applicants:</h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Our group has unlimitted quotas for Post-Docs. Besides all the benefits provided by Tsinghua, our group will provide an <b>additional 200,000 to 300,000 RMB annual compenstation</b> to outstanding applicants. Feel free to send <a href="../team">[me]</a> an email for subsequent discussions. </p>
