                            ISRG was founded in May of 2013 to serve as a home for public-benefit digital infrastructure projects, the first of which was the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt certificate authority</a>. ISRG's founding directors were Josh Aas and Eric Rescorla. The group's founding sponsors and partners were Mozilla, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the University of Michigan, Cisco, and Akamai.
