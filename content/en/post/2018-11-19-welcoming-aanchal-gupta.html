<p>We are delighted to announce our newest board member: Aanchal Gupta, Director of Security at Facebook.</p>

<p>Aanchal brings a depth of experience in leading security and privacy initiatives, including previous work at Microsoft and Yahoo. Throughout her career, Aanchal’s work has focused on how encryption can benefit people using the internet. As she described it, “The internet is part of the very fabric of who we are. If we can make it safer for everyone - that’s our family, our friends, and our kids, we will build stronger and safer communities.”</p>

<p>This end-user mindset is incredibly important to us at ISRG and drives many choices we make. Secure digital infrastructure can only happen with the cooperation of many large organizations, but our end goal is a more secure and privacy-respecting Web for the average person.</p>

<p>Aanchal also carries the perspective of someone who builds for scale. In her time at Facebook, she worked on securing the services used by billions of users. “I have learned many lessons about how to operate and deliver secure services at scale, and look forward to sharing best practices around what works and what doesn't," she said.</p>

<p>Scalability is one of ISRG’s foremost concerns in our focus on supporting critical digital infrastructure. Let’s Encrypt was designed from the start to be able to scale to serve a large portion of the Web. When we assess the feasibility of future projects, we think about how they can do the most good for the most people. We appreciate that Aanchal will bring experience with scale to the conversation.</p>

<p>Lastly, Aanchal’s deep commitment to diversity will help us ensure the future of the Web is built for the diverse composition of people who rely on it. Internally, she has built diverse teams, and she has represented the importance - and presence - of diverse people at last year’s OurSA conference.</p>

<p>We look forward to working with Aanchal for years to come.</p>
